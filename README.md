### 1. Dynamic Programming
- Signs:
  - Overlapping Subproblems 
  - Optimal Substructure (buying travel tickets)
- steps: 
  - write recursive
    - reduce args
  - draw recurse tree
    - det state
    - det old vs new state relation
  - write DP
    - inputs becomes axes (e.g 3 inputs => 3D DP)
1. **Fibonacci** - 1D: since only need prev val and prev-prev val, beginning always directly affects answer
  - Decode Ways 
  - Climbing Stairs
2. **0/1 Knapsack** - 2D: since need 2 types of vals: avail items and target val
  - Equal Subset Sum Partition
```python
def knapsack(vals, wts, W):
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(W + 1)] for _ in range(len(vals) + 1)]
    for i in range(len(dp)):                #items
        for w in range(len(dp[0])):         #weights
            if i == 0 or w == 0:            #if you're not considering any items or you have 0 allowed wt
                dp[i][w] = 0
                                            # if curr item's wt is too large, we cant consider it for this curr wt
                                            # so just refer to val above ()
            elif wts[i - 1] > w:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]     # Up
            else:
                                            # max of: best val while not considering the curr item and 
                                            # val of curr item + best while not considering the curr item at the remaining weight
                                            # max(UpLeft, Up)
                dp[i][w] = max(vals[i-1] + dp[i - 1][w - wts[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][w])
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

3. **Boundless Knapsack** (can repeat items) 1D: since only need to know best val at lower weight
  - Coin Change
```python
def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
     max = float('inf')
                        # [0, inf, inf, inf...]
        dp = [0] + amount * [max]
                        # dont need to cover amount == 0 since we already have it in "dp"
                        # add 1 to iter up to amount
        for amt in range(1, amount + 1):
                        # add 1 since we're spending/using a coin now
                        # amt - coin can be == 0 since we need to hit 0..
                        #           use max if you would go below 0 (invalid coin option)
                        # Left
            dp[amt] = min([dp[amt - coin] if amt - coin >= 0 else max for coin in coins]) + 1
                        # 2 elem arr and we idx either at 0 or 1
                        # if dp.last == inf, True is 1 so then return -1
                        # if dp has a val, False is 0 so return that val
        print(dp)
        return [dp[amount], -1][dp[amount] == max]
```

4. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence** - 2D: 2 Pointers on 1 arr/str to delin a Window (Palindrome-specific)
```python
bbbab
12345
                    # 1 2 3 3 4 <-- res
                    # 0 1 2 2 3
                    # 0 0 1 1 3
                    # 0 0 0 1 1
                    # 0 0 0 0 1
n = len(s)
dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] 
for i in range(n): #seed the cells where i == j
    dp[i][i] = 1
for cl in range(2,n+1):           # DIAGONAL traverse
    for i in range(n - cl + 1): # "nickel"
        j = i + cl - 1  # "icicle"
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2   #looks LD
        else:
            dp[i][j] = 
                                # logic for break in palindrome
                                # can resume by using other squares (if doing "subsequences", can use max(L, D, LD))
return dp[0][-1]                # return TopRight
```
5. **Longest Common Substring** - 2 Pointers (1 on each arr/str), beginning might not directly affect answer
  - Longest Common Subseq (LCS)
  - Shortest Common Superseq
```python
def LCS(text1, text2):
    m = len(text1)
    n = len(text2)  

    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]   #0 buffer
    for i in range(1, len(dp)):                 
        for j in range(1, len(dp[0])):  
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:                # DP is 1-indexed
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1             # LeftUp + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])  #carry through max(Left, Up)
    return dp[-1][-1]        #BottomRight
```
  - Longest Increasing Subseq (LIS)
```python
def LIS(nums):
    if not nums: return 0
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:           #   if curr val > earlier val and it'd sets new best then look Left 
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j])
    return max(dp) 
```

- 2D array for X vs. Y "graph"
- Probability
- Memoizing: @functools.lru_cache(None)     (not dp, only similar)

### 2. Sorts and Searches
- Quick sort - worst case O(n^2)
- Merge sort - stable
- Insertion sort
- Radix sort
- Iterative B-search
```python
    lo, hi = 0, len() 
    while(lo < hi) {
        mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    if( #Special condition passed)(optional):
        return mid; 
    if( #condition passed)
    hi = mid;
    else 
    lo = mid + 1;
    }
    return lo;
```
- bisect.bisect(iterable, target) does BS but returns idx + 1 so do - 1 after
  - can also find where to insert a target
- Reservoir Sampling
- random.random()*3#1  (0, 1, 2)

### 3. Graphs
- visited
  - separate 2D array 
  - visited = set() .add(str([xi, yj]))
- Tradeoffs
  - Adjacency matrix
  - graph
  - Class
- BFS, DFS
- Graph - BFS
  - don't use [-1] for ranges (will mess up when combined with dirs)
```python
visited = set()
dirs = []
for x, y in dirs:
    xi, yj
    if 0 <= xi < len and 0 <= yj < len
        if (xi, yj) not in visited:
```
```python
visited = set()
q = []
while q:
    q.pop
    visited.add
    for neighbor in .neighbors:
        if not in visited:
            q.append
```


### 4. Trees
- acyclic graphs
- Traversals
  - inorder gives sorted
- DFS
```
.left
.right
```
- BFS
```python
q = []
newQ = []
newQ << .left
newQ << .right
```
- Level Order
- Tries
  - creating - #words * #avgLetters
  - searching - #letters
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = collections.defaultdict(TrieNode)   # makes itself {ref: TreeNode}
        self.isWord = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()  #abstracts away TrieNode
    def insert(self, word):
        root = self.root
        for c in word:
            root = root.children[c]  #creates the child if not there
        root.isWord = True
    def search(self, word):
        root = self.root
        for c in word:
            root = root.children.get(c) #does not create
            if not root: return False
        return root.isWord
```

- Heaps
  - heapq
    - .heapify(<arr>)
    - .heappush(<heap>, el)
    - .heappop(<heap>)
  - sorts ASC by [0] so [0][0] is the smallest val it sees
  - insert and delete are O(logn)
  - creating a heap is NOT O(nlogn) even though it's n els * logn insert time...
    - time is amortized to **O(n)**
  - insert => sift up
  - remove min/max => swap then sift down

### 5. Strings and Arrays
- ord() and chr()
- Kadane’s - largest contig sum in subarr
- Two pointers
- Slow and Fast pointer
- satisfying additional subarrays: 
    res += count
    count += 1
- Moving Window
```python
counts = { } #usually a hash of element frequencies in window (collections.Counter)
currCount #some constraint on window
bestLength = 0
start = 0
for end in range(len(string)):
    currCount += function(input[end])               #el at end contributes to currCount

    if :                                #if window does not satisfy (e.g end - start - 1 > constraint or currCount > constraint):
        currCount -= function(input[start])                 #el at start is no longer being considered
        start += 1

    bestLength = max(bestLength, end - start + 1)           #update bestLength
      
return bestLength
```
- in-place:
  - make els - 

### 6. Intervals
- Inserting
  - map based on start, [0], sort, bisect.bisect(arr, newInterval[0]), then .insert
```python
    starts = [interval[0] for interval in intervals] 
    starts.sort()
    idx = bisect.bisect(starts, newInterval[0])
    intervals.insert(idx, newInterval)
```
- Merging
  - if [i][1] > [i + 1][0] then set [i][1] to max([i][1], [i + 1][1])
  if current's end is GREATER than next's start, then set currs end to the GREATER end
```python
    merged = [intervals[0]]        #seed it with the 1st interval
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if merged[-1][1] >= intervals[i][0]: #last el's end
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], intervals[i][1]) # absorb it
        else:
            merged.append(intervals[i])
    return merged
```
- isOverlap?
  - start1 < end2 and start2 > end1
- Overlap area
  - max(start1, start2) - min(end1, end2)
### 7. Pathing

- Dijkstra’s (2 dicts and 1 set)
  - finds shortest distance to every node
  - visit all nodes once
    - for each node, check dist for all neighbors
(source is “a”)
```python

        def findClosest(self, best, visited): #Find the closest (to orig src), unvisited node 
            res = None
            for node in best:
                if node not in visited and (not res or best[node] < best[res]):
                    res = node
            return res
                                                    # K = starting node, N = # of nodes
                                                    # all nodes receive signal
        graph = collections.defaultdict(dict)
        for edge in edges:
            graph[edge[0]][edge[1]] = edge[2]       #graph[src][dest] = edge
  
        best = dict()           # {a: 2, b: 3}
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            best[i] = float('inf')
        best[K] = 0
        
        visited = set()
        
        for _ in range(N): 
            closest = self.findClosest(best, visited)
            visited.add(closest)
            for neighbor in graph[closest]:
                best[neighbor] = min(best[closest] + graph[closest][neighbor], best[neighbor])    # src to curr + curr to neigh

        for val in best.values():       #check if we can reach every other node
            if val == float('inf'): return -1
         
        return          #some value in best                      
```

### 8. Bit manipulation
- & | ~
- ^ 
  - finds rightmost 1
  - finds the one duplicate el
- << >>   multiply by 2
- change / check / clear a specific bit
  - shift a "1" over X times using <<
  - maybe ~ (not) it
  - & or | it with your number
- bin() to convert to bin OR
 - format(<num>, '#010b') to keep padding
- int(<binary string>, 2) to convert back to int

### 9. Other Data Structures / Algorithms
- Union Find (num of connected components)
  - keep finding a deeper root until the root matches the node
```python
# input: 
# edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]               # list of undirected edges
# n  = 5

# n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

roots = [i for i in range(n)]

def find(key):
    while key != roots[key]:
        key = roots[key]

for edge in edges:
    root1 = find(edge[0])
    root2 = find(edge[1])
    if root1 != root2:
        roots[root1] = root2
        #logic for being in same group ex: count -= 1
    else:
       #logic for being in diff group
```
- Topological Sort (alien dic)
  - for Directed Acyclic graphs
  - orders are not the only "right" answer
  - when you've explored all prereqs/predecessors, then add it to "order"
  - DFS method (recursive calls) or BFS (Queue)
  - need to sometimes check for cycles too
```python
    input:
    words = {"baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"} #(given sorted)

    prereqs = {
        : []
    }

    order = []

    visited = {}

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neigh in neighbor:
            if not in visited: dfs(neigh)
        order.append(node)

    for node in numNodes:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)

    return order[::-1]

```

### 10. Backtracking
- can mutate outer res using 
  - [] assignment
  - .append
- can change curr using:
  - curr + [ ]
  - curr.append  curr.pop
- copy.deepcopy(arr) 
- Combinations / Permutations
  - list(itertools.combinations(arr, #)) [(), ()]
  - list(itertools.permutations(arr, #)) [(), ()]
```
res = []
def recurse(curr, idx)
    res.append(curr[::]) if
    for i in range(idx, len)
    .append
    recurse
    .pop
recurse([], 0)
```
- .isdigit  
- .isalpha
 
### 11. Linked Lists
- Strategies:
  - fast and slow - finds middle, start of cycle
    - Deleting -
    - Dummy node
- Reversing - 3 pointers
    - Null node
- Merging - 3 pointers
    - swap between lists
- triple swaps

```python
tail, head = l1, l1
l1 = l1.next            #l1 head already accounted for by tail
while l2:
    tail.next = l2
    l2 = l2.next
    tail = tail.next
    if l1:
        l1, l2 = l2, l1
return head
```

### 12. Stacks / Queues
- .deque 
- validParens
```python
count = 0
for char in s:
    if char == "(":
        count += 1
    elif char == ")":
        count -= 1
        if count < 0: return False
return count == 0

```

### 13. Extra Knowledge
- Rabin Karp - hashing to find pattern in string
  - turn curr window into hash (integer. e.g 234)
  - convert when window slides (e.g. 345)
  - if currWindow hash == target hash, then compare actual chars
- Self-balancing Trees
  - AVL
  - Black Red Trees
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (finding every prime up to n)
  - check every number up to n 
  - eliminate every num starting at n^2 and incrementing by n
  - go to next unelimiminated 
- Bellman-Ford - one node to others
- Floyd-Warshall - short dist poss between all pairs of nodes
  - n^3
- Minimum Spanning Trees 
  - Kruskal - sort edges, keep adding smallest edge (not nec contiguous) that would connect trees
  - Prim - choose random node, keep choosing smallest accessible edge that would add an unvisited node


### Key Python methods
- list(string)      #how to split a word
- ternary
  - x = 1 if True else 2  #no colon
- [[for j in range] for i in range]
- array iterating backwards
  - [::][::-1]
  - dont use [-1:0:-1]  (starts at [-1], doesnt touch [0]) (awkward...)
- collections
  - Defaultdict		like Hash.new(0)
  - Deque
  - Counter.items()
- sorted(    .sort(key=
  - sorts by [0] by default for 2D arrs
  - ([0], [1]) *tuple* to sort by multiple fields
- reversed(    .reverse
- Find 	rfind()  	like indexOf
- Strings
  - lstrip rstrip
  - startswith() endswith()
- [list(row) for row in list(zip(*reversed(board)))]  starboard! (Python3 syntax)
  - need to convert zip object
- Arrays: 
  - any(el > 5 for el in arr)
  - all(el > 5 for el in arr)
    - len(set(a) == 1)  #checks if all the same val
  - del arr[] 
  - remove(val) 
  - insert(idx, val)
  - extend(arr2)
  - "map" == [x**2 for x in arr] 
    - map(lambda a: , <iter>)
  - "filter" == [x for x in arr if x > 2] 
    - filter(lambda a: <iter>)
  - "flatten" == [y for x in graph[x] for y in x]
- Sets:
  - can't hash lists / dicts (CAN hash objects)
  - declared with { }
  - set1.union(set2) |= 
  - set1.intersection(set2) &=
  - .add 
  - .discard/.remove to remove 
- range(start, end, step)
- sum(<2darray>, []) will flatten it
- isinstance(<item>, <type>)
 
- range is a lazy iterable like iterators but range is not an iterator
  - iterators

Suggestions:
LL => pointers
rotated / sorted => bSearch
logn time => bSearch / bTree
k branches at each level of recurs tree, n levels => k^n time
top k => min or max heap / quickselect
items in arr/str interacting => stack
rectangle/meeting time/free time => interval
anagram => hash
subsequence => dp
prereqs => topo sort

Time complexities:
Trees: 
    (n^2) to make BST (worst case)
    (nlogn) to make AVL
    (n) to make Heap
    => heap is only way to improve time complexity
    finding kth smallest => 
      k log n => for minHeap
      (n-k)log k => for maxHeap (this approach is faster)
        see problem #215
        
        
    O(n) to traverse tree   
    
    Search, insert, delete
    Binary Tree
        O(n)
    BST
        O(n) but technically, O(h) 
    AVL
        O(logn)
    when to make a tree:
        sorted array - O(n) insert. would need to reallocate (re-size)
        linked list - O(n) search
